# 👋🏻 Hello! I'm Hetvi Gandhi<br/>

Welcome to my user page. I'm a student at UC San Diego pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.<br/>
I would call myself a programmer with a passion for building cool things, solving interesting problems and most importantly learning something new and improving my skills everyday.<br/>

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me<br/>

*"You may never know what results come of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no results."* ~Mahatma Gandhi<br/>
<br/>
**Totally unrelated… except for the name… and the existential pressure to be wise all the time 😂**<br/>
<br/>
As a student at UCSD, I've worked with a range of programming languages ranked below in the order of comfortability:
- C and C++
- Python
- Java
- R Programming

In my free time I enjoy:
- Going for walks and watching the sunset
- Driving around
- Listening to music
- Cooking

I am currently looking for an internship which has the potential to convert to a full-time job after I graduate 🤞.<br/>
<br/>
So future employers, this is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hetvi-gandhi-79b264324) do check it out 😁.<br/>
For more info, go to my [goals](#goals).<br/>

One of my favorite lines of code and in my opinion the best line of code is `print(Hello World!)` 😂.

As a side note, this is me doing something I love and yes I'm aware you cannot see my face but look at the view. [This is me!](Thisisme!.png)

## ✅ Goals<br/>

1. Get my dream internship/job.
2. Buy a Mercedes Benz G-Wagon.
3. Be happy and successful.
4. Make my family proud (not that they aren't already).
